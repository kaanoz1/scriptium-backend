/**
The Writings project has an unusual comment system in line with the project purpose. With the purpose of represent, you can inspect the diagram below in which capital letters represent users and symbols prefixed with "c" represents the comment made my corresponding users. Besides that, capital letters with sign ~ indicates that his users account is private. Finally, the parenthesis rightmost represent if external user is able to see relevant comment.
For instance, let suppose that external user is A and comment schema looks like this:

cA(+)
     cB~(+)

Implies that there is top comment which is cA, and a comment whom wants to reply that one which is cB with private account, and external user which is user A can see both.

In Writings comment system grounds that statements:
1. Users can see the comment made by ones they follow.
2. Users can see their comments.
3. Users cannot see replies to their comments unless the replierâ€™s account is private and the user does not follow the replier.
4. Users can reply comments whichsoever they see.

For demonstrating the comments system the writings project has, there are 2 state following.

State 1.

Lets suppose that external user is X and user V followed by user K and Z. User X follows user V and Z.

cV(+) 1*
     cX(+) 2*
     cK(-) 3*
          cV(-) 4*
     cZ(+) 5*
          cV(+) 1*

1*: User X can see this comment because he/she follows user V.
2*: User X can see this comment as it is his/her comment.
3*: User X cannot see this comment because he/she does NOT follow user K.
4*: User X cannot see this comment despite to following user V, since this comment attached the comment belongs to user V does not follow.
5*: User X can see this comment because user Z is followed by user X.

State 2:

Let's assume that user X is the external user. And user X follows no one.

cX(+) 1*
     cK(+) 2*
          cK(-) 3*
          cX(+) 4*
    cV(+) 5*
          cX(+) 6*
     cS~(-) 7*
           cV(-) 8*

1*: User X can see this comment as this comment belongs to his/herself
2*: User X can see this comment even if he/she does NOT follow user K. Because this comment attached on his own comment and user K does not have private account.
3*: User X cannot see this comment. Because of not following the user K, it does not matter that user X can see comment number 2.
4*: User X can see this comment because the reason mentioned for comment number 1.
5*: User X can see this comment because of following the user V.
6*: User X can see this comment because the reason mentioned for comment number 1.
7*: User X cannot see this comment even if this comment replies his comment. Because user S has private account and relevant user does not follow user S.
8*: User X cannot see this comment because he does not follow user S.

As for notes. Notes considered top comment for user whoever belongs to. (Will be implemented)
